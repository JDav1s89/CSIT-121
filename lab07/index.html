            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>Canadian slacker and musician, Scott Pilgrim, who suffers from a moderate case of arrested
                development, spends his days playing music with his friends and just generally goofing off until he
                meets the girl of his literal dreams, Ramona Flowers. Ramona unfortunately is carrying a lot of
                unresolved emotional baggage much like Scott so in order for them to date he he has to do the
                totally
                normal thing of defeating her seven evil exes.

            <h3>Review:</h3>
            <p>For someone who grew up heavy on the video games of the late 90s, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is a
                nostalgic ride filled with easter eggs, musical stings, familiar images, and hilarious references.
                From
                the very beginning showcasing the character's names and attributes in the style of a video game
                character's stats screen all the way to the ending featuring a "Game Over, Continue?" screen,
                there's a
                constant jolt of amusement of seeing something that you recognize or remember from your childhood.
                The
                film is an adaptation of the graphic novel series "Scott Pilgrim" by Bryan Lee O'Malley and is
                directed
                by Edgar Wright, known for other amazingly hilarious movies such as Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and
                The
                World's End. The performance by all of actors is one that oscillates between charming and endearing
                and
                hilariously awkward which is what gives the delivery of the film's sharp writing a unique edge. The
                visuals of the film is full of excellent 8-bit effects and aesthetic coolness that anyone who is a
                fan
                of comic book action or anime will largely enjoy. I personally saw the movie a number of times when
                it
                first came out in 2010 and then another couple times when it was re-released for its 10 Year
                Anniversary. If you're looking for a fun, amazing, video game reference heavy movie then definitely
                check out Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.
