        <h2>XML</h2>
        <p class="question">What is XML?</p>
        <p>XML <span id="acronym">(Extensible Markup Language)</span> is a markup language that is designed to allow the
            storage and
            transportation of
            data. It is separate from the structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) elements of a web page.</p>
        <p class="question">How is XML used?</p>
        <p>XML is used to store, distribute, and query data. It does not have any predefined tags and so it has the
            ability
            to accurately define whatever data is stored within the document as long as it follows the standardized XML
            syntax rules.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="question">What is JavaScript?</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is unique in that it can be run within the browser and therefore
            allows
            for client-side scripting. Due to JavaScript being able to run within the browser it allows for numerous
            forms
            of multimedia functionality that does not require a webpage to be refreshed.</p>
        <p class="question">How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</p>
        <p>If a webpage was thought of as a grammatical sentence then JavaScript could be thought of as the verbs.
            JavaScript deals with actions and functionality, whereas HTML would be considered the nouns or structure and
            CSS
            as the adjectives or styling of the words.</p>
        <p class="question">What are some common JavaScript elements, properties, methods, and functions?</p>
        <p><span class="jssubheader">Element:</span> JavaScript elements are all of the HTML objects that can be
            selected and manipulated via the Document Object Model.
            <br>
            Ex. The "Window" object is an object representing an open window in a browser.
        </p>
        <p><span class="jssubheader">Property:</span> JavaScript properties are the values that are associated with any
            JavaScript object.
            <br>
            Ex. The "lastModified" property is the property that contains information related to when the last time a
            file
            was saved or modified.
        </p>
        <p><span class="jssubheader">Method:</span>
            A method is an action that can be performed on objects. One common JavaScript Method is the Alert method
            which is used to cause the browser to render a popup box
            which can contain information provided to the user.</p>
        Ex.<br>
        <textarea rows="4" cols="20">alert("This is an Alert method.")</textarea>
        <p><span class="jssubheader">Function:</span> A JavaScript function is a block of code created to do something.
            They are often used in conjunction with an Event Listener to trigger it.
